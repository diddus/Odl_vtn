Virtual Tenant Network (VTN)

https://docs.opendaylight.org/en/stable-fluorine/user-guide/virtual-tenant-network-(vtn).html

The uniqueness of VTN is a logical abstraction plane. This enables the complete separation of logical
plane from physical plane. Users can design and deploy any desired network without knowing the physical network topology
or bandwidth restrictions.Once the network is designed on VTN, it will automatically be mapped into underlying physical
network, and then configured on the individual switch leveraging SDN control protocol.

 -- VTN Overview -- 
It is implemented as two major components
 > VTN Manager
 > VTN Coordinator

VTN Manager
An OpenDaylight Plugin that interacts with other modules to implement the components of the VTN model. 
It also provides a REST interface to configure VTN components in OpenDaylight. 
VTN Manager is implemented as one plugin to the OpenDaylight. This provides a REST interface to create/update/delete VTN components. 
The user command in VTN Coordinator is translated as REST API to VTN Manager by the OpenDaylight Driver component. 
In addition to the above mentioned role, it also provides an implementation to the OpenStack L2 Network Functions API.

Features Overview
odl-vtn-manager provides VTN Manager’s JAVA API.
odl-vtn-manager-rest provides VTN Manager’s REST API.
odl-vtn-manager-neutron provides the integration with Neutron interface.
REST API
VTN Manager provides REST API for virtual network functions.

Here is an example of how to create a virtual tenant network.

curl --user "admin":"admin" -H "Accept: application/json" -H \
"Content-type: application/json" -X POST \
http://localhost:8181/restconf/operations/vtn:update-vtn \
-d '{"input":{"tenant-name":"vtn1"}}'
You can check the list of all tenants by executing the following command.

curl --user "admin":"admin" -H "Accept: application/json" -H \
"Content-type: application/json" -X GET \
http://localhost:8181/restconf/operational/vtn:vtns

****
 -- VTN Coordinator --
The VTN Coordinator is an external application that provides a REST interface for an user to use OpenDaylight VTN Virtualization. 
It interacts with VTN Manager plugin to implement the user configuration. It is also capable of multiple OpenDaylight orchestration.
VTN Coordinator will use the REST interface exposed by the VTN Manger to realize the virtual network using OpenDaylight.

 -- Virtual Network Construction --
vBridge 	             The logical representation of L2 switch function.
vRouter 	             The logical representation of router function.
vTep 	                 The logical representation of Tunnel End Point - TEP.
vTunnel 	             The logical representation of Tunnel.
vBypass 	             The logical representation of connectivity between controlled networks.
Virtual interface 	   The representation of end point on the virtual node.
Virtual Linkv(vLink)   The logical representation of L1 connectivity between virtual interfaces.
****
 -- Mapping of Physical Network Resources --
Port mapping 	Maps physical network resources to an interface of vBridge using Switch ID, Port ID and VLAN ID of the incoming L2 frame. 
              Untagged frame mapping is also supported.
VLAN mapping 	Maps physical network resources to a vBridge using VLAN ID of the incoming L2 frame.Maps physical resources of a 
              particular switch to a vBridge using switch ID and VLAN ID of the incoming L2 frame.
MAC mapping 	Maps physical resources to an interface of vBridge using MAC address of the incoming L2 frame(The initial contribution 
              does not include this method).


curl --user "admin":"admin" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8181/restconf/operations/vtn:remove-vtn -d '{"input":{"tenant-name":"vtn2"}}'
